**1. SUSPICIOUS FINDINGS:**

1.  **Process Name/Connection:** NetworkCap.exe
    - **PID:** 3248
    - **Reason for Suspicion:**  Uncommon process name. "NetworkCap" suggests a network capture utility, which could be used for malicious purposes like capturing keystrokes or other sensitive network data.  The name itself is not inherently malicious, but its presence without clear justification is suspicious.
    - **Threat Score:** 7

2.  **Process Name/Connection:** OmenCap.exe
    - **PID:** 3500
    - **Reason for Suspicion:** Uncommon process name. Similar to NetworkCap, "OmenCap" sounds like a tool designed to capture data, possibly related to keylogging or network monitoring.  The unusual name and lack of an obvious owner raise suspicion.
    - **Threat Score:** 7

3.  **Process Name/Connection:** SysInfoCap.exe
    - **PID:** 3652
    - **Reason for Suspicion:** Uncommon process name.  Suggests a system information capture tool, potentially used to collect information for later malicious use, including keylogger data alongside other system details.
    - **Threat Score:** 7

4.  **Process Name/Connection:** AppHelperCap.exe
    - **PID:** 4044
    - **Reason for Suspicion:** Uncommon process name. Following the pattern of other "Cap" processes, this suggests data capture functionality with unknown intent.  The generic name is a red flag.
    - **Threat Score:** 7

5.  **Process Name/Connection:** DiagsCap.exe
    - **PID:** 4072
    - **Reason for Suspicion:** Uncommon process name.  "DiagsCap" implies diagnostic data capture; however, without a clear association with a known diagnostic tool, it is suspicious and potentially a front for a keylogger or other malware.
    - **Threat Score:** 7

6.  **Process Name/Connection:**  Multiple svchost.exe processes with "None" owner
    - **PID:** 868, 1300, 1464, 1544, 1720, 1844, 1888, 1916, 2004, 2036, 2044, 2132, 2144, 2204, 2236, 2272, 2280, 2336, 2412, 2440, 2632, 2652, 2688, 2728, 2784, 2796, 2964, 2976, 3128, 3384, 3524, 3624, 3708, 3732, 3736, 3748, 3916, 4008, 4016, 4024, 4336, 4824, 4972, 5012, 5140, 5412, 5544, 5648, 5660, 5728, 5788, 6000, 6120, 6160, 6172, 6420, 6428, 6588, 6624, 6676, 6748, 8308, 8548, 8728, 9044, 9208, 9420, 10124, 10468, 10576, 10928, 11496, 13360, 13704, 14500, 14536, 16792, 16980, 17180, 18248, 18284, 18764
    - **Reason for Suspicion:**  `svchost.exe` is a legitimate process, but multiple instances with no owner are highly suspicious.  This is a common tactic used by malware to hide its presence.
    - **Threat Score:** 9


7.  **Process Name/Connection:** Multiple processes with "None" owner
    - **PID:** 188, 232, 736, 1128, 1232, 1240, 1308, 1328, 1336, 1400, 1584, 1592, 1676, 1788, 2596, 3112, 3432, 3500, 3900, 4636, 4856, 5324, 5816, 6088, 6192, 6200, 6212, 6248, 6404, 6408, 6512, 6520, 6548, 6684, 7524, 8256, 9140, 9244, 9452, 9684, 11632, 12512, 5740
    - **Reason for Suspicion:** Processes without a defined owner are a significant red flag, suggesting they may have been launched by malware.
    - **Threat Score:** 8

8.  **Process Name/Connection:** PID 9044 (Numerous Connections)
    - **PID:** 9044
    - **Reason for Suspicion:** This process has a high volume of network connections, to various IP addresses and ports, including  non-standard ports (1900). While a browser might have many connections, this pattern is unusual for most applications and points towards suspicious activity.
    - **Threat Score:** 8


**2. OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**

The system shows a cluster of suspicious activity.  Multiple processes with names suggesting data capture capabilities ("Cap" suffix) and many processes lacking owners are observed.  The high number of network connections associated with PID 9044 further amplifies the risk.  While the individual threat scores are not extremely high, the combination of these findings paints a worrying picture of potential malicious software activity. The sheer number of processes with "None" as the owner is particularly alarming.


**3. FINAL VERDICT:**

[HIGHLY LIKELY MALICIOUS ACTIVITY DETECTED]


**4. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**

1.  Immediately disconnect the system from the network to prevent further communication and data exfiltration.
2.  Run a full system scan with multiple reputable anti-malware tools in safe mode.
3.  Initiate a forensic analysis of the system to identify the exact malware and its impact.  This may involve examining registry entries, file system changes, and network logs.
4.  Change all passwords associated with accounts used on this system.
5.  Monitor network activity closely after remediation to ensure the malware has been completely removed.
6.  Consider reinstalling the operating system if the malware proves difficult to eradicate.


**Final Keylogger Installation Chances:** 95/100
**Safety Score:** 5/100
